# Cokecoder
A simple console app made with C#

Cokecoder is my take on a symmetric encoder. This app converts text into a code and back in different ways. 

# What is symmetric encoding?
Basically, it is a system in which a secret key is shared between two people wishing to send private messages. The messages are encrypted and decrypted with the help of this key.
By default, the key in this program is set to 1; it is recommended to change it using the command /key [int]

 # What is the point of this particular program?
 This program has not been uploaded intending for others to use it. It is only uploaded as an outlet for my simple projects. That being said, anyone is free to use this script if they find anything useful.
